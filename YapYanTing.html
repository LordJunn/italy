            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Yan Ting and I am studying at Multimedia University as a foundation student.<br><br>
                I'm an introvert and I don't talk much usually, but I like music a lot.
                I like to listen to songs and I like to sing. My favourite singer is a Malaysian singer called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/azorachin/?hl=en" target="_blank">Azora Chin</a>.
                He is a very handsome boy and he sings very well. He always gives me positive energy and is very gentle.
                It's really a very, very happy thing to like him.<br><br>
                I like handicrafts too. There are many kinds of handicrafts, but my favourites are pottery and paper craft.
                These are two crafts that take a long time to do. I have a slow pace of life so I think it is just right for me.
                Every time I make a craft I feel calm and I feel a sense of satisfaction and achievement when I see the final product.
                I think handicrafts are a hobby that makes me happy, but because I am too slow and too much of a persuit of perfection,
                my family did not support me to study art.<br><br>
                And I really like to sleep. I think it's like being reborn.
                Whether it's a mental or physical discomfort, every time I wake up from a sleep everything is better.
