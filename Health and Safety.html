      <h1 id="water-quality"> Water Quality </h1>
    <p>
      Drinking water from the tap in Italy is considered safe. Tap water in the major cities and towns around Italy is safe for consumption,
       and there are thousands of old-style water fountains dotted around cities, like Rome, where you can fill up water bottles. Some very rural 
       areas in Italy may have water that is not safe to drink. If there is a sign reading ‘acqua non potabile’, this means that the water is not
        safe to be ingested. If you wish to drink purified water, bottled water is abundantly available in stores, especially in tourist areas. 
        However, be aware of your environmental impact when purchasing water in plastic bottles, and consider filling a reusable bottle or canteen 
        with water from your hotel for your day of sightseeing instead.

       <h3> 1. Forest fires </h3> 
      Forest fires are a risk during the extended summer months. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable; check with local 
        authorities if you’re considering travelling to affected areas. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas and report 
        fires to the emergency services. 

      <p>
        <h3> 2. Flooding </h3> 
       High waters known as “acqua alta” are a common occurrence in Venice during the winter months and can cause flooding in parts of the city. 
        You should monitor local media and weather reports and follow the advice of local authorities in affected areas. 
      </p>

      <p>
       <h3> 3. Earthquakes</h3> 
       Many parts of Italy lie on a major seismic fault line. Minor tremors and earthquakes are a regular occurrence.

    <!-- Common crimes -->
    <div class="inner-box1">
      <h1 id="crimes">Common Crimes </h1>
    
       <h3> 1. Murder </h3> 
      In 2012, national murder rate was about 0.9 per 100,000 population, one of the lower rates in Western Europe.
       There were a total of 530 murders in Italy in 2012.

      <p> 
         <h3> 2. Organized crime </h3> 
        Many worldwide crime organizations originated in Italy, and their influence is widespread in Italian society, directly affecting a 
        reported 22% of citizens and 14.6% of Italy's Gross Domestic Product. Public figures such as former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi
         have been charged with association in organized criminal acts. War against organized crime caused hundreds of murders, including judges
         (Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino) and lawyers (like Roberto Calvi).
      </p>

       <p>
       <h3> 3. Sexual violence </h3> 
       According to Police authorities data, the rate of sexual assaults per 100,000 inhabitants is significantly higher in the Northern region than
        in the Southern ones. In 2009, Lombardia and Emilia Romagna were the regions with the highest rate of sexual offences per 100.000 inhabitants 
        (9.7); followed by Trentino Alto Adige and Tuscany (9.5); Piedmont and Liguria (8.6); Umbria (8.4). In this respect, all major Southern regions
         like Sicily (6.8); Calabria (6.5); Apulia (6.2); Campania (6,0) were the safest in the national territory, with the only exception of Friuli 
         Venezia Giulia (5.1) in the North.
      </p>

      <p>
         <h3> 4. Fraud </l3> 
        Fraud is a major contributor to Italy's crime rate, with some level of fraud appearing in all sectors of the economy since the country's founding
         in 1861. Notable cases of financial fraud include the collapse of Parmalat in the early years of the 21st century, and the Lockheed bribery
          scandal in the 1970s.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3> 5. Corruption </h3> 
        Political corruption remains a major problem in Italy, particularly in Southern Italy including Calabria, parts of Campania and Sicily where
         corruption perception is at a high level. Political parties are ranked as the most corrupt institution in Italy, closely followed by
          public officials and Parliament, according to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3> 6. Drug-related crimes </h3> 
        Italy is considered one of the drug portals to Europe thanks to its geolocation and omnipresence of organised crime groups.
         Substantial amounts of illegal drugs are smuggled through the country with the goal of reaching other European nations. These narcotics
          are exported from drug producing regions principally via maritime route but also via air and land. Areas such as South America, specifically
           Colombia produce and supply cocaine, Southeast Asia and Afghanistan principally supply heroin, whereas north-western and south-eastern Europe,
            Morocco and Albania cultivate and deliver cannabis. The drugs are bought and distributed both in Italy and in the rest of Europe by 
            organised crime groups.
