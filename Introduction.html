 <p>
    Italy has a lot of interesting information. It's one of the most travelled to nations in Europe. The history is extensive.
     Rich cultural heritage. The meal is also delicious. What precisely do you know, though? Here are some fascinating Italian-related facts.
 </p>

    
  <h2> 1. Italy Becomes a Unified Peninsula </h2>
 <p>
    In 1713, after the War of the Spanish Succession, Milan, Naples, and Sardinia were handed over to the Hapsburgs of Austria,
    which lost some of its Italian territories in 1735. After 1800, Italy was unified by Napoléon, who crowned himself king of Italy in 1805;
    but with the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Austria once again became the dominant power in a disunited Italy. Austrian armies crushed 
    Italian uprisings in 1820–1821 and 1831. In the 1830s, Giuseppe Mazzini, a brilliant liberal nationalist, organized the Risorgimento 
    (Resurrection), which laid the foundation for Italian unity. Disappointed Italian patriots looked to the House of Savoy for leadership.
    Count Camille di Cavour (1810–1861), prime minister of Sardinia in 1852 and the architect of a united Italy, joined England and France 
    in the Crimean War (1853–1856), and in 1859 helped France in a war against Austria, thereby obtaining Lombardy. By plebiscite in 1860,
    Modena, Parma, Tuscany, and the Romagna voted to join Sardinia. In 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi conquered Sicily and Naples and turned 
    them over to Sardinia. Victor Emmanuel II, king of Sardinia, was proclaimed king of Italy in 1861. The annexation of Venetia in 1866
    and of papal Rome in 1870 marked the complete unification of peninsular Italy into one nation under a constitutional monarchy.

 <h2> 2. Italy is one of Western Europe's youngest countries </h2>
 <p>
    Italy has one of Europe's longest histories, yet it's only been a country since 1861. In Roman times, Italy was a single entity.
     It then divided into a collection of sovereign states and remained that way until 1861.
 </p>

 <h2> 3. Rome is over 2,000 years old </h2>
 <p>
    Rome was founded in 753 BC and the Roman Empire was born in 27 BC. The Empire ruled Europe and parts of North Africa right up until 395 AD. 
    After the fall of the Empire, Italy divided into separate states until 1861. Italy's national day is called Festa della Repubblica and it's 
    celebrated each year on 2 June.

 <h2> 4. Italy's flag is green, white and red</h2>
 <p>
    Italy's flag represents hope, faith and charity. Green is hope, white denotes faith and red is the colour of charity. Inspired by the French flag,
     it's often called Il Tricolore. Tricolore Day in Italy is 7 January. And it's celebrated on Reggio Emilia, at the very spot where the flag was
      first adopted in 1797.

 <p>
    Carlo Collodi wrote the legendary story Pinocchio in 1880. It was originally serialised in the children's newspaper, Gioniale per i Bambini.
