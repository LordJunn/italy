                <p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum.  It was built under the emperor Vespasian in 72 and was completed in 80 AD. Three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the medieval era.</p>
